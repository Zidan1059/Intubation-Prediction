# Intubation-Prediction
The dataset contained the data of patients who were under the Intubation Process.
We calculated the percentage of patients who were COVID positive and died after
being Intubated. We also calculated the patients who were not COVID positive but
were Intubated and died. We can see that Patients who were COVID positive and
Intubated had a higher fatality rate than the patients who were not effected with
COVID. This indicates that intubation process for COVID-19 is very crucial.Patients
who were COVID positive and intubated had a higher possibilty of death that the
patients who were now COVID positive.
This work is depicted in the Fatality of Intubation.
 Intubation requirement prediction was done using 5 ML classifiers.
